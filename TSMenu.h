// This is a library for creating, displaying, and using a 
// hierarchical menu on the TinyCircuits TinyScreen
// It uses the four buttons as follows:
// top left == go back
// top right == enter (forward)
// bottom left == down/decrease
// bottom right == up/increase
//
// It is mainly intended to allow for creating settings
// menus for whatever device you have created with TinyScreen
//
// Each menu is a list of text items and has a label
